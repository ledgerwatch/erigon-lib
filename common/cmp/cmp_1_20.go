// that supports the operators < <= >= >.
// If future releases of Go add new ordered types,
// this constraint will be modified to include them.
//
// Note that floating-point types may contain NaN ("not-a-number") values.
// An operator such as == or < will always report false when
// comparing a NaN value with any other value, NaN or not.
// See the [Compare] function for a consistent way to compare NaN values.
