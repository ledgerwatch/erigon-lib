// https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module
//
// This module is just a hack for 'go mod tidy' command
//
// Problem is - 'go mod tidy' removes from go.mod file lines if you don't use them in source code
//
// But code generators we use as binaries - not by including them into source code
// To provide reproducible builds - go.mod file must be source of truth about code generators version
// 'go mod tidy' will not remove binary deps from go.mod file if you add them here
//
// use `make devtools` - does install all binary deps of right version

// build tag 'trick_go_mod_tidy' - is used to hide warnings of IDEA (because we can't import `main` packages in go)
